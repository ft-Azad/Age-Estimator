## 1. Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust automated age estimation system that can reliably predict a person's age solely from a facial image, while addressing the challenges of facial appearance variability, occlusions, pose variations, and imbalanced age distributions in available datasets. The system should be able to generalize well across diverse populations and real-world scenarios, and provide age predictions in a timely manner, making it suitable for deployment in a variety of real-time applications that require age-related insights or personalization, such as demographic analysis, security screening, and personalized user interfaces and services.
